Performed comprehensive data preprocessing including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling. Engineered new features such as "amenity score" and "location convenience index" to improve model accuracy. The model analyzes user requirements and budget constraints to recommend the best hostel options. Includes interactive Power BI dashboards that visualize hostel distribution by price range, amenity comparison across different locations, and price trend analysis. Users can input their preferences (budget, location, amenities) and receive personalized hostel recommendations with predicted rental costs.',

The system uses pulse sensors connected to Arduino microcontroller to continuously monitor vital signs including heart rate, pulse rate, and blood oxygen levels. When abnormal readings are detected (heart rate too high/low, irregular pulse patterns), the system immediately triggers automated SMS alerts via Twilio API to designated caretakers, family members, or medical staff with patient information and current vital signs. Python scripts handle data collection, real-time analysis, and alert generation. The system logs all vital sign data for historical analysis and trend monitoring. Designed as a low-cost, easy-to-deploy solution that can be set up in homes without extensive technical knowledge. Particularly valuable in areas lacking immediate access to medical facilities, providing crucial minutes that can save lives during cardiac emergencies.',

The project involved extensive data preprocessing including handling missing age values through intelligent imputation, extracting passenger titles (Mr., Mrs., Miss) from names as a proxy for social status, and creating new features like family size by combining siblings/spouses and parents/children counts. Performed exploratory data analysis using statistical visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships between variables. Conducted rigorous hypothesis testing to validate key findings: women had significantly higher survival rates than men, first-class passengers were more likely to survive than third-class, and children had better survival odds than adults. Built and tuned multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) achieving 78%+ prediction accuracy. The project demonstrates strong understanding of the complete machine learning pipeline from data cleaning to model evaluation, and the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.',
